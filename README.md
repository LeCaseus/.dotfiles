## Theming

| Layer | Tool/Setting |
|---|---|
| Color scheme | Gruvbox (via Noctalia) |
| Icons | Fluent-dark (fluent-icon-theme) |
| Cursor | Silksong cursor theme |
| GTK3 | nwg-look |
| Qt | qt6ct |
| Dark mode | Noctalia + GTK settings files |

**Icon install:**
```bash
sudo dnf copr enable dusansimic/themes
sudo dnf install fluent-icon-theme
```
Set `Fluent-dark` in nwg-look (GTK) and qt6ct (Qt).

**Fonts:** Fira Code, Fira Sans, Twemoji

---

## Portals & System Integration

- `xdg-desktop-portal` + `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` (primary — most compatible with Niri)
- `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=KDE` set in Niri environment (for portal activation)
- Polkit kf6 + Noctalia polkit plugin
- wl-clipboard + cliphist
- mimeapps.list configured

> Architecture note: gnome-leaning app stack on Niri compositor. Nautilus, gnome portal, GTK apps where available. This is the pragmatic correct choice for Niri in 2026 — gnome portal handles ScreenCast and file pickers. Qt apps themed independently via qt6ct.

---

## Cloud & Sync

- **OneDrive** — syncing `~/` with `skip_dotfiles` and `skip_dir` configured

---

## Boot Optimizations

These changes were made outside `~/` to reduce boot time. Documented here for reference.

### Kernel parameters — quiet boot

```bash
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="quiet loglevel=3"
```

Stops boot messages printing to screen. Logs still accessible via `journalctl`.

**Revert:** `sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="quiet loglevel=3"`

---

### Disabled services

```bash
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
sudo systemctl disable dnf-makecache.timer
sudo systemctl disable ModemManager.service
```

| Service | Reason disabled |
|---|---|
| NetworkManager-wait-online | Blocked boot until network was fully up; network still connects in background |
| dnf-makecache.timer | DNF was refreshing package metadata cache at boot; not needed |
| ModemManager | Mobile broadband manager; no modem hardware present |

**Revert any of them:** `sudo systemctl enable <service-name>`

---

### GRUB timeout

Set `GRUB_TIMEOUT=0` in `/etc/default/grub`, then rebuilt config:

```bash
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```

Boots straight to default entry. To access the GRUB menu when needed, hold **Shift** or spam **Esc** immediately after BIOS handoff.

**Revert:** Set `GRUB_TIMEOUT=5` in `/etc/default/grub` and rebuild.

---

### Boot time (post-optimization)

```
firmware:   ~7s    (BIOS/UEFI — not reducible without BIOS tuning)
loader:     ~6.6s  (GRUB — reduced from 8.7s after timeout change)
kernel:     ~944ms
initrd:     ~6.5s  (dracut + hardware enumeration — expected)
userspace:  ~4.2s  (healthy)
─────────────────
total:      ~26s
```

Firmware and initrd times are largely hardware-bound.

## Known Issues & Ongoing Notes

### niri-session deprecation warning

`niri-session` calls `systemctl --user import-environment` without a variable list, which triggers a systemd deprecation warning on login and shutdown. Tracked upstream at [niri#254](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/issues/254). Harmless — left as-is pending upstream fix.

A hacky workaround exists (redirect stderr in greetd config), not applied. Waiting for a proper fix.

### Gray screen + three dots before tuigreet

Expected. The gray is Niri's compositor surface initializing as a backdrop for tuigreet. The three dots are tuigreet's loading indicator. Not a bug.

### Services noted but not yet disabled

| Service | Notes |
|---|---|
| `sshd` | In critical boot chain at ~519ms. Safe to disable if SSH into this machine isn't needed: `sudo systemctl disable sshd` |
| `avahi-daemon` | mDNS/Bonjour. Not needed on a personal desktop, safe to disable |
| `abrtd` | Fedora crash reporter. Safe to disable if not submitting bug reports |
| `firewalld` | Keep — provides firewall |

## Pending / Future

- [ ] Firefox "Open With" extension for Office Online
- [ ] Navidrome external access (Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel) for partner music sharing
- [ ] Greeter theming (tuigreet is functional but plain)
- [ ] Noctalia Terra repo GPG key cleanup
- [ ] Slow shutdown — not yet investigated
